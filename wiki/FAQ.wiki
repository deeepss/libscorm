  * Which versions of SCORM does the library support?
  SCORM 2004 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions.
  * Does LibSCORM support SCORM 1.2?
  Not yet.
  * I have a question that is not answered by the guide wiki, can I get support?
  Yes, contact Joe Nelson at the ADL Academic Co-Lab. http://www.academiccolab.org/email/22/field_email
  * Is the "release candidate 3" safe?
  Should be. Version 2.7 is a major rewrite. It seems to work well but I want to test it in a real project before releasing it officially.
